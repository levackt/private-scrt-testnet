# [LocalSecret](https://docs.scrt.network/docs/development/local-secret) is the perfect start for a developer, providing a local, instant, zero-config Secret Network blockchain.
When it's time to go from "Works on my machine" to the rest of your team, a public testnet is gebnerally the next step.
There are times however, when you may need a private testnet, an environment where you can control network governance, do performance tests, test alternate versions, etc.
This project can spin up such an environment in a couple of minutes, using docker-compose currently.
